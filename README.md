# T3 App with uploadthing configuration

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) template project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app` and configured to use [uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com/).

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

This is a template project, used to illustrate how to get started with `t3-app` and `uploadthing`.

In the spirit of `create-t3-app`, the goal is to try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.
